# Simple Thermodynamic Ice Models (STIM)

STIM provides a common interface of ice models to hydrodynamic models.

The aim is to separate the actual ice algoorithms from the hydrodynamic model such that only a well-defined small interface is needed in order to test and use a variaty of different ice models.

As a proof of concept two different models are included in this initial release. Also included is a driver for [GOTM](https://www.gotm.net).
