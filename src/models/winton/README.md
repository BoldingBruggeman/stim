# Winton ice model

This is a wrapper around the ice model from [MOM5](https://mom-ocean.github.io/). Specifically this [subroutine](https://github.com/mom-ocean/MOM5/blob/master/src/ice_sis/ice_thm.F90) is used - almost - un-altered.

The model is described in this [publication](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/mw0001.pdf).
